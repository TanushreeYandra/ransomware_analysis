Anglo-Saxon Period (410-1066 AD): After the Romans withdrew from Britain, Germanic tribes such as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes migrated to the island and formed the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This marked the beginning of English language and culture.

Norman Conquest (1066 AD): In 1066, the Normans, led by William the Conqueror, defeated the Anglo-Saxon King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This resulted in Norman rule over England, which lasted for several centuries.
