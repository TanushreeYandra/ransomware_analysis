Ancient Britain:
The first inhabitants of Britain were the Celts, who arrived around 800 BC. They built hill forts and settlements, and developed their own language and culture.

Roman Britain:
In 43 AD, the Romans invaded Britain and ruled it for over 300 years. During this time, they introduced new technologies, languages, and infrastructure, such as roads, aqueducts, and cities.

Anglo-Saxon Britain:
After the Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century, Britain was invaded by various Germanic tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. These groups merged and formed the Anglo-Saxon culture, which would later develop into the English identity.

Norman Conquest:
In 1066, the Normans, led by William the Conqueror, invaded England and defeated the Anglo-Saxon king, Harold II. This event marked the beginning of Norman rule in Britain, which lasted for over 300 years.
