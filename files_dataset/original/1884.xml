1. Ancient Roman Festival: The origins of Valentine's Day can be traced back to the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia, which was celebrated in mid-February to honor the god of fertility, Faunus, and the goddess of love, Venus. During the festival, men would sacrifice a goat and a dog, then whip women with leather strips called "lupercalia" to promote fertility.
2. Christian Martyrdom: According to legend, St. Valentine was a priest who lived in Rome during the 3rd century AD. Emperor Claudius II had outlawed marriage for young men because he believed single men made better soldiers. St. Valentine defied the emperor's decree and secretly married couples in love, earning him banishment and ultimately his martyrdom.

The holiday became associated with romantic love during the Middle Ages when courtly knights expressed their devotion to their ladies through elaborate gestures and gifts.
4. Victorian Era Revamps Valentine's Day: In the 19th century, the tradition of exchanging love messages, gifts, and flowers on Valentine's Day became popularized thanks to Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert. They helped make the day a symbol of romance and affection.
