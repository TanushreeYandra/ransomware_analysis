<root><text_content>Of course, I'd be happy to help! Valentine's Day has a rich and fascinating history that spans over 2,000 years. Here's a brief summary:

Valentine's Day originated in ancient Rome, where it was celebrated as a pagan festival called Lupercalia. During this festival, men would sacrifice a goat and a dog and then whip women with the hides of these animals to promote fertility. Yes, you read that right! The festivities also included matchmaking and pairing off of women with men by lottery.

In the 5th century AD, Pope Gelasius declared February 14 as St. Valentine's Day to honor the martyrdom of Saint Valentine, a Christian priest who defied the Roman Emperor Claudius II by performing marriages in secret when he had outlawed them. According to legend, Valentine was beheaded for his actions and the day became associated with romantic love.

Over time, the holiday evolved into an occasion for expressing love and affection between couples, with exchanging gifts, flowers, and cards becoming commonplace. In the 19th century, the tradition of sending valentines began, which led to the widespread commercialization of the holiday we know today.
